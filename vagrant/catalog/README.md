This containts code that I implemented following the udacity course for 
[FullStack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088)

To run this you can download resturantMenu folder and execute finalProject.py in db_config folder.

Will keep working on it and improving it and putting my experiences on the [blog] (https://wordpress.com/post/beabetterwebdeveloper.wordpress.com/25)
